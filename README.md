### User Defaults

#### Enable key repeat in OS X

Mac OS X Lion introduced a new, iOS-like context menu when you press and hold a key that enables you to choose a character from a menu of options. You can disable this feature globally by issuing the following command in your terminal:

```
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

#### Change the default location for screenshots

Create the new desired directory if it does not already exist. Then in the terminal run:

```
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /path/to/screenshots/ && killall SystemUIServer
```

## Xcode

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is an integrated development environment for macOS containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS.

Download and install it from the App Store or from [Apple's website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

To install Xcode command line tools run:

```
xcode-select --install
```

It will prompt you to install the command line tools. Follow the instructions and you'll have Xcode and Xcode command line tools both installed.

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) calls itself "the missing package manager for macOS" and is an essential tool for any developer.

### Installation

Before you can run Homebrew you need to have the Command Line Tools for Xcode installed. It includes compilers and other tools that will allow you to build things from source. See [previous section](#xcode).

To install Homebrew run the following in a terminal and follow the steps on the screen:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

To use brew you will need to start a new terminal session. After that you should make sure everything is working by running:

```
brew doctor
```

If everything is good, you should see no warnings, and a message that you are "ready to brew!".

## Terminal

### iTerm2

[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is an open source replacement for Apple's Terminal. It's highly customizable and comes with a lot of useful features.

#### Installation

Install iTerm2 via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask iterm2
```

#### Font

To enable italics rendering, run:

```sh
{ infocmp -1 xterm-256color ; echo "\tsitm=\\E[3m,\n\tritm=\\E[23m,"; } > /tmp/xterm-256color.terminfo
tic /tmp/xterm-256color.terminfo
```

Install preferred font:

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-fira-code
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg
brew install --cask font-source-code-pro
```

Set the font in iTerm2's preferences and change the size to 13pt.

#### Color Theme

_DEPRECATED recommendation_

Download `Tender.itermcolors` from [github.com/tombell/tender-iterm2](https://github.com/tombell/tender-iterm2). Go to _Preferences > Profiles > Colors_ and select _Import..._ from the _Color Presets..._ dropdown. Import the theme and select it from the _Color Presets..._ dropdown.

### Zsh

[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive login shell and as a shell script command processor. Zsh has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a host of other features.

#### Installation

Install zsh via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install zsh
```

#### Configuration

The main configuration file for zsh is _.zshrc_ in the user home folder. Create, modify, or copy from [github.com/ryantoddgarza/dotfiles](https://github.com/ryantoddgarza/dotfiles). Other configuration files may be necessary such as _.zshenv_, _.zprofile_, _.zshlogin_, _.zlogin_, and _.zlogout_.

To apply configuration changes to an existing session, simply re-invoke Zsh by running `zsh`. This will source any of the above mentioned files that exist [in a specified order](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Files.html#Files). To source only a specific file, _.zshrc_ for example, run `source ~/.zshrc`.

##### Oh My Zsh

A popular choice if you have no existing configurations.

[Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. It comes with a bunch of features out of the box and improves your terminal experience.

#### Common issues

##### Insecure directories fix

For the error `zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.`, run:

```sh
compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
```

Details available at [Stephen Weiss' Blog](https://stephencharlesweiss.com/blog/2020-03-28/zsh-compinit-insecure-directories/).

Another suggested solution is:

For the error `Insecure completion-dependent directories detected`, add `ZSH_DISABLE_COMPFIX=true` to the top of your .zshrc file. Reload the file by running `source .zshrc`.

### Tmux

[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

#### Installation

Install tmux via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install tmux
```

#### Configuration

Copy the .tmux.conf file from [github.com/ryantoddgarza/dotfiles](https://github.com/ryantoddgarza/dotfiles) into the home directory.

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Install Git:

```
brew install git
```

When done, to test that it installed properly you can run:

```
git --version
```

And `which git` should output `/usr/local/bin/git`.

Next, we'll define your Git user (should be the same name and email you use for [GitHub](https://github.com/):

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
```

They will get added to your `.gitconfig` file.

To push code to your GitHub repositories, we're going to use the recommended HTTPS method (versus SSH). To prevent git from asking for your username and password every time you push a commit you can cache your credentials by running the following command, as described in the [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/).

```
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

### SSH Config for GitHub

The instructions below are referenced from the [official documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).

#### Check for existing SSH keys

First, we need to check for existing SSH keys by running:

```
ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
```

Check the directory listing to see if you have files named either `id_rsa.pub` or `id_dsa.pub`. If you don't have either of those files then read on, otherwise skip the next section.

#### Generate a New SSH Key

If you don't have an SSH key you need to generate one. To do that you need to run the commands below, and make sure to substitute the placeholder with your email. The default settings are preferred, so when you're asked to "enter a file in which to save the key," just press Enter to continue.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
```

#### Add Your SSH Key to the ssh-agent

Run the following commands to add your SSH key to the `ssh-agent`.

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

If you're running macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your `~/.ssh/config` file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain. If no file exists, create one and add:

```
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

No matter what operating system version you run you need to run this command to complete this step:

```
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub Account

The last step is to let GitHub know about your SSH key. Run this command to copy your key to your clipboard:

```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Then go to GitHub and [input your new SSH key](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new). Paste your key in the "Key" textbox and pick a name that represents the computer you're currently using.

### Git Ignore (global)

Create the file `~/.gitignore`. Add files that are almost always ignored in all Git repositories or the contents of [macOS specific .gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/macOS.gitignore) maintained by GitHub itself.

followed by running the command below, in terminal:

```
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
```

### Git GUIs

They exist if you need them.

- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Vim

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple macOS.

### Installation

To install the latest version, use Homebrew:

```sh
brew install vim
```

### Configuration

Even though stock vim is extremely powerful, some configuration may be desired to suit a personal workflow or to make learning more enjoyable to newcomers. Though customizing vim is entirely beyond the scope of this document, vim ships with incredible documentation. Enter `:help options` for help configuring vim's available options for example.

#### Some sensible configs

##### Display

In `.vimrc` add:

```
set number " Display line numbers
set backspace=2 " Backspace behaves like other applications
```

##### Color scheme

Download `monokai.vim` from [github.com/crusoexia/vim-monokai](https://github.com/crusoexia/vim-monokai) and add it to the `~/.vim/colors` directory. Add `colorscheme monokai` to `.vimrc`.

More useful color schemes at [github.com/rafi/awesome-vim-colorschemes](https://github.com/rafi/awesome-vim-colorschemes).

#### Config from dotfiles

Clone the appropriate _.vim\*_ files from [github.com/ryantoddgarza/dotfiles](https://github.com/ryantoddgarza/dotfiles) into the home directory.

#### The Ultimate vimrc config

A popular choice if you have no existing configurations.

[The Ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) is a collection of vimrc configurations to make easy the usage of vim.

### Plugins

Plugins are packages of Vim config code that can add functionality, mappings, and commands to your Vim as well as add support for new programming languages. My [.gitmodules](https://github.com/ryantoddgarza/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitmodules) are a versioned resource for my installed plugins. Among them are:

- [ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale): Check syntax in Vim asynchronously and fix files, with Language Server Protocol (LSP) support.

## Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

### Installation

Node.js can be installed in different ways. One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package manager like Homebrew.

```sh
brew install node
```

Alternatively, Node version managers allow you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm on your system so you can test your applications on multiple versions.

### Node Version Manager

[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a version manager for node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell.

#### Install

Install **Node Version Manager** with cURL.

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.36.0/install.sh | bash
```

Verify installation:

```sh
command -v nvm
```

which should output `nvm` if the installation was successful.

#### Basic usage

```sh
nvm ls                          # List installed versions
nvm ls-remote                   # List versions available to be installed
nvm install node                # Install the latest stable version
nvm install <version>           # Install a specific version
nvm install --lts=<LTS name>    # Install from long term support versions
nvm use <version>               # Switch between versions
nvm alias default <version>     # Set default version with alias
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Fix the "Missing write access" error when using npm

_Pay attention to the folder listed by the error message. If itâs different, update the chown command accordingly._

Run this command:

```sh
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules
```

## CLI Extensions

### Browsersync

[browsersync.io](https://www.browsersync.io/) Synchronized browser testing.

Install and run browser-sync inside of the project folder. Requires `node.js`. Refer to the [Node.js section](#nodejs). Install `browser-sync` globally:

```
npm install -g browser-sync
```

After installing `browser-sync` we can run it inside any folder in our system and it will create a local server (automatically displaying the default index.html file you have in the folder).

```
browser-sync start --server --files .

# abbreviated options are as follows
browser-sync start -sf .
```

### Rsync

Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. It can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync daemon. It offers a large number of options that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible specification of the set of files to be copied. It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination. Rsync is widely used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.

#### Update rsync With Homebrew

Install the latest version via Homebrew:

```
brew install rsync
```

Check version:

```
rsync --version
```

#### Basic Usage

The basic syntax is:

```
rsync <options> <source> <destination>
```

#### Usage - Mirror Directory

```
rsync -acXNv --delete <source> <destination>
```

The options used are:

- `-a`, `--archive` archive mode; equals `-rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)`
- `-c`, `--checksum` skip based on checksum, not mod-time & size
- `-X`, `--xattrs` preserve extended attributes
- `-N`, `--crtimes` preserve create times (newness)
- `-v`, `--verbose` increase verbosity

#### Documentation

- [rsync Manual](https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/rsync/)

### SASS

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is a stylesheet language thatâs compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

Install with Homebrew:

```
brew install sass/sass/sass
```

### Tree

- [Tree](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/) is a recursive directory listing command that produces a depth indented listing of files.

Install with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install tree
```

## Apps

A list of apps that are generally good to use and can come in handy in day to day tasks.

### Developer Tools

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) is a developer friendly browser with powerful development tools built in to it.

Install with Homebrew:

```
brew install --cask google-chrome
```

### Productivity

- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) File syncing to the cloud. It syncs files across all devices (laptop, mobile, tablet), and serves as a backup.
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) a universal document converter.
