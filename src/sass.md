## SASS

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

Install with Homebrew:

```
brew install sass/sass/sass
```
